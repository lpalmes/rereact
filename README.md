# Rereact

### Looking for a better name, and ideally under 5 letters :)

## Getting started

Clone the repo and install bsb and friends with `npm install`

After that run `npm run start` in one terminal window to run the compiler, and `npm run bundle` in other window to run parcel to bundle the app, open localhost that parcel defined

go into `index.re` to try out hot code reloading, and playing with the app
